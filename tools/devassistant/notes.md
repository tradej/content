# Notes

## Using the Command Line Interface vs. the GUI

DevAssistant is currently undergoing a major overhaul of its internal
architecture, and one of the results is the current GUI being dropped in favour
of a web-based one. The DevAssistant developers have trouble finding the time
and people to maintain the GUI, so for the time being, plase consider using the
command-line interface since for the optimal results.
